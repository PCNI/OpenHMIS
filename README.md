OpenHMIS
========

The OpenHMIS project is an [open source](LICENSE.md),
[standards-based](API.md) HMIS (Homeless Management Information
System).

OpenHMIS is set of open standards for storing and exchanging HMIS data
securely; it is also a collection of open source online services, web,
and mobile applications that use those standards to communicate.
OpenHMIS applications collect [HUD](http://hud.gov/)-required data and
generate all HUD-mandated reports, and support data exchange, data
warehousing and more advanced reporting/data mining through the API.
See [OpenHMIS.org](http://openhmis.org/) for more information.

This repository contains the OpenHMIS API specification, and a server
implementing that API.

For more about the API, please see [API.md](API.md).

For more about the server code, please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
