  NOTE: The copyright terms for this file are unclear.  Because Google
  clearly encourages an application's users to download it to the
  client side, and equally clearly encourages application developers
  to arrange things such that users will do this, it seems that at the
  very least verbatim redistribution of the file is permitted.  See
  https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/issues/93 for
