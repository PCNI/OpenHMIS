Installing OpenHMIS
=================================================================
 
General Notes:
-------------------
* This code base is expected to be built using Maven, and deployed to Tomcat.
* We are using MySQL as a data store.
* Although several core developers are using Eclipse, this is not a requirement to contribute.


Create a local build:
---------------------
The instructions below explain how to set up a development environment capable of running the API endpoints.  This section assumes you have already used git to download a local copy of the code base.

_In order for those endpoints to function correctly, you must also create a local copy of the schema._

1. Install JDK 1.7.x

   On Debian GNU/Linux 'testing' dist as of 2015-07-30, `sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk` should work.

2. Install [Maven (3.x)](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

   On Debian GNU/Linux 'testing' dist as of 2015-07-30: `sudo apt-get install maven`.

3. Install [Tomcat 7.x](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi). Note that there may be a more recent version of Tomcat, but as of 2015-06-22 Maven plugins do not appear to exist beyond Tomcat 7.

   On Debian GNU/Linux 'testing' dist as of 2015-07-30, some combination of `sudo apt-get install libtomcat7-java tomcat7 tomcat7-admin tomcat7-user tomcat7-common tomcat7-docs tomcat7-examples` should do the trick.  If you install the Tomcat server correctly, you can visit http://localhost:8080/ and see a message saying "It works" and giving details about Tomcat configuration paths, etc.

4. Install [MySQL 5.x](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

   (Most Debian GNU/Linux systems already have the `mysql-server` and `mysql-client` packages installed.)

5. Create a Tomcat admin by editing `<TOMCAT7_PATH>/conf/tomcat-users.xml`.

    ```XML
        <tomcat-users>
                <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
                <role rolename="admin-script"/>
                <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
                <!-- We don't need 'manager-jmx' and 'manager-status' 
                     roles for this application, but feel free to
                     add them if you need them for other reasons. -->
                <role rolename="manager-script"/>
                <user username="admin" password="password" 
                      roles="admin-gui,admin-script,manager-gui,manager-script" />
        </tomcat-users>
    ```

   On Debian GNU/Linux, `TOMCAT7_PATH` above is usually `/var/lib/tomcat7`.  This path is also known as `CATALINA_BASE` in Tomcat-speak, and the corresponding `CATALINA_HOME` would be `/usr/share/tomcat7`.

6. Restart Tomcat

    ```Shell
        $> cd <CATALINA_HOME>   # (e.g., /usr/share/tomcat7)
        $> bin/shutdown.sh
        $> bin/startup.sh
    ```

   Or, on many Unix-like systems:

    ```Shell
        $> sudo service tomcat7 stop
        $> sudo service tomcat7 start
    ```

7. Update Maven's settings by editing `<MAVEN_PATH>/conf/settings.xml` so that Maven will be able to use the Tomcat user in step 3.

   On Debian GNU/Linux, `MAVEN_PATH` is `/usr/share/maven`.

   The `username` and `password` must match those set in step 3.  The ID must be `TomcatServer`.
        
    ```XML
        <settings ...>
                <servers>
                        <server>
                                <id>TomcatServer</id>
                                <username>admin</username>
                                <password>password</password>
                        </server>
                </servers>
        </settings>
    ```


Create the schema:
------------------
Database migrations are performed using [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/).
_Note: you do not need to install anything for this to work.  Flyway is automatically loaded and used by Maven._

1. Using your tool of choice, create an empty MySQL schema, and create a user with access to it.

   The name of your schema is up to you; in this example we use
   `openhmis`.  The username and password are likewies up to you; here
   we use `openhmis_user` and `openhmis_password`.

    ```shell
        $> mysql -u root -p
        (...enter database admin password...)
        mysql> create database openhmis;
        mysql> create user openhmis_user@localhost identified by "openhmis_password";
        mysql> grant ALL on openhmis.* to openhmis_user@localhost identified by "openhmis_password";
    ```

2. Create a local `src/config/flyway.properties` file with your database connection information

    The schema name, username, and password entered in this file must match those created in step2 1

    ```shell
        $> cp src/config/flyway.properties.example src/config/flyway.properties
        $> vi src/config/flyway.properties
    ```

3. To initialize and update the schema, run the following command in the `pom.xml` directory

    ```shell
        $> mvn clean compile flyway:migrate
    ```

4. Configure the code base to work with your schema by creating and populating the `src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml` file.

   The database url, username, and password entered in this file must match those created in steps 1 and 2

    ```shell
        $> cp src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml.example src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml
        $> vi src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml
    ```

Import sample data (or real data, if you have some):
---------------------------------------------------

```shell
        mysql -u openhmis_user -p openhmis < src/main/resources/db/data/DATA.sql
```

Run the web service:
--------------------

1. Ensure that Tomcat is running (generally you can do this by going to http://localhost:8080)

2. Using a Command Line Interface, navigate to the root directory of this code base.  It should be the one containing `pom.xml`

3. Deploy using Maven:

    ```shell
        $> mvn tomcat7:deploy
    ```

   If you have previously deployed this code with any tool, you will need to _redeploy_ using Maven.

    ```shell
        $> mvn tomcat7:redeploy
    ```
        
   If successful, the output will end with a message similar to the example below:
        
    ```shell
        [INFO] tomcatManager status code:200, ReasonPhrase:OK
        [INFO] OK - Deployed application at context path /openhmis
        [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
        [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        [INFO] Total time: 4.488 s
        [INFO] Finished at: 2015-06-22T14:43:19-04:00
        [INFO] Final Memory: 20M/165M
        [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

4. If your web service is properly configured, [http://localhost:8080/openhmis/api/v3/healthcheck](http://localhost:8080/openhmis/api/v3/healthcheck) should display "Your service is working." 

5. If the schema is properly set up, [http://localhost:8080/openhmis/api/v3/clients](http://localhost:8080/openhmis/api/v3/clients) should yield a valid XML object.
